}
\arguments{
\item{bib_file_path}{Path to a BibTeX (.bib) file to be read.}
}

}
\description{
This internal helper wraps \code{\link[RefManageR:ReadBib]{RefManageR::ReadBib()}} with structured
condition handling to provide robust error, warning, and message reporting
using the {cli} package.
}
\details{
The function attempts to read and parse a BibTeX file into a data frame.
On success, the parsed entries are returned. If parsing results in ignored or
empty entries, or if any fatal error occurs, a formatted diagnostic is emitted
and the function aborts. Warnings and messages from RefManageR are displayed
with {cli} formatting but do not stop execution.
